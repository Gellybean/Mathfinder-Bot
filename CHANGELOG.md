Changes since last big update...

- Added a user context menu, `Roll Off`. This will give you an option when you right-click on a user inside `App` called `Roll Off`. When selected, you will be prompted to type an expression for which you want to roll against. Once an expression is submitted, it will prompt the active channel with a button that only works for the "challenged" user. They can then click on it to generate an opposed roll. 
- Fixed tons of parsing bugs.
