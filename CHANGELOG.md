Changes since last big update...
  - Added a `metamagic` field to /spell. This will allow you to apply one or many metamagics before determining the spell description, as well as any formulae that may be included.
  - You can now omit the "1" from single die rolls. For example, `d20` vs `1d20`.
  - Standard Emojis can now be used as variable names. ðŸ¤·
