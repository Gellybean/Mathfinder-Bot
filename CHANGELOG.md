Changes since last big update...

- Autocompleteâ€”Many fields will now offer suggestions.
- Updated `/spell`. Removed the `expr` field. Added an optional `caster-level` field to give you a modified version of the spell desciption. Scaling values in the description will be **bolded**.
- You can now comment expressions by enclosing them inside [ ] brackets.
- Added a keep highest `h` and lowest `l` option to for dice expressions. If you want to roll 4d6 and drop the lowest result, you would use `4d6h3` (keep the highest 3). You could roll 2d20, keeping the lowest roll by doing `2d20l1` (keep the lowest 1).  Using a multiplier with either symbol will split each iteration into separate rolls. This is useful when rolling stat arrays, such as `4d6h3 * 6`.
- Added an optional `is-hidden` field for `/item`. It will still be hidden by default.
- Semicolons `;` can now to used in expressions to separate evaluations, thus allowing you to combine eval into one line or stored value. 
- You can now enclose variable names in quotes `"`, which allows for spaces. However, Statblock vars will still be converted to upperspaced/underscored before any evalulation is made. Other than convenience, this will be used for preset modifiers, and other values that can include spaces.
