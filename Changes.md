Changes since last big update...

- Autocompleteâ€”Many values will now offer suggestions.
- Updated `/spell`. Removed the `expr` field. Added an optional `caster-level` field to give you a modified version of the spell desciption. Scaling values in the description will be **bolded**.
- You can now comment expressions by enclosing them inside [ ] brackets.
- Added a keep highest `h` and lowest `l` option to for dice expressions. If you want to roll 4d6 and drop the lowest dice, you would use `4d6h3` (keep the highest 3). You could roll 2d20, keeping the lowest roll by doing `2d20l1` (keep the lowest 1).  Using a multiplier with either symbol will split each iteration into separate rolls, adding up individual rows. This is useful when rolling ability score arrays.
