# MathfinderBot v0.5

Mathfinder is a Discord bot built as an expression parser and stat-tracker for Pathfinder 1e. Its features include:

- A math engine you can use to create useful expressions
- Create customizable statblocks to store all your variables 
- 3rd party import options to update your stats
- Transform expressions into buttons
- Basic inventory management
- Item reference with inventory interaction
- Spell reference with options for calculating values that rely upon caster level
- Tools for DMs, including the ability to evaluate targeted character sheets, secret rolls, roll requests
- Bestiary containing complete entries and buttons for melee/ranged attacks
- Making your Pathfinder experience more convoluted than ever!

This bot contains a number of commands, but its core functionality revolves around [`/eval`](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/eval). This is where you can roll dice, create and save expressions, as well as modify your statistics using pathfinder's bonus-stacking rules. Most other commands utilize eval in some way.

This is a big work in progress, with plenty of room for improvement. Please feel free to let me know what you think on here or Discord. The [**Command Reference**](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki) should help you with basic usage.

## Getting Started
**NOTE**—If you don't want to manage the many variables that come with a default statblock, you can just start using [`/eval`](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/eval), it will generate an empty statblock automatically.

To create a character, use the [`/char`](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/char) command with the `New` action.

Once a character is created, you can update it using the `Update` action, as well as list your stats and expressions using [`/var`](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/var)

## Stats & Expressions
Statblocks contain three primary values: Stats, Expressions, and Expression Rows (buttons). 

Each `Stat` contains a base value, as well as a list of bonuses. Each `Bonus` contains a value, a name, and a bonus-type. Together, these are used to accurately calculate the total of any stat when bonuses are applied. (Stacking rules are based on PF1e).

`Expressions` are formulae. These can represent anything from a constant number to an expression of expressions including any number of stats. 

For usability, stats and expressions share a pool of variable names.

`Expression Rows` are groups of buttons that execute an expression. You can assign them to a variable using /var with the `Set-Expression` action. You can then call them at any time using `/row`.

**NOTE** — The default character sheet contains a number of both stats and expressions that represent the values you would find on any standard character sheet. This includes ability scores, saves, skills, cmb/cmd, modifiers, etc. Many of these values are important when using certain features, such as preset modifiers, that affect specific variables.

To view these values, use `/var` with the `List-Vars` option.

## Rows
You can `/eval` expressions individually, or you can use Discord's UI features. `/row` is used for this.

These rows are sets of buttons. These can call any value from your sheet or be entirely unique. This is useful when representing something like a weapon's attack and damage values. You can create your own rows from scratch using `/var` with the `Set-Row` action, or they can be saved from a preset (such as weapons in /item). use the `/row` command to call any created rows.

MF-Bot comes with many different preset commands for things like equipment, creatures, stat modifiers including spells and conditions. You can bring up pre-programmed attacks for creatures, or use your own stats when selecting different creature shapes. Check out the Wiki entries for more details.

 - [/best](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/best#bestiary) — Bestiary
 - [/item](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/item#item) — View or Add items to your inventory, generate preset expressions for weapons, apply bonuses from equipment with a button click.
 - [/rule](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/rule#rule) — List common rules, conditions, class abilities.
 - [/shape](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/shape#shape) — List abilities and generate expressions for your attacks.
 - [/spell](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/spell#spell) — List spells, provide an optional caster level for scaling values.



## Character Sheet Imports
While you can setup a character by manually modifying values, why not use your favorite character creator instead? 

Mathfinder currently supports a few import options. This way you can use apps more suited for character management while keeping your statistics (and therefore any expressions/buttons that reference them) up to date.

### PCGen
 - Using the export option `csheet_fantasy_rpgwebprofiler.xml`. Tested with v6.09.05.

### HeroLabs
 - Using the XML export option

### Pathbuilder
 - Using the exported PDF

### Mottokrosh's Character Sheet
 - Using the JSON export
 
 ### RPG Scribe
 - Using the exported TXT file.

**NOTE** — There are specific limitation when parsing different sheets. For instance, not all bonus types may be known for a given stat, and cannot be applied accurately, but the totals should remain correct. This can affect the proper calculation of stacking bonuses. I do my best! Also, expect general issues with parsing—Some options I've tested more thoroughly than others. Please let me know, and I will fix them.


## Q&A

### -> Does it support things beyond basic actions? (like attack type feats? Vital strike?)
*from /u/Elgatee*

![expr3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10622391/194180919-4701f99f-0d71-44ff-a7b2-fb9bbd4da515.jpg)

For Vital Strike, you would need to multiply the weapon's damage dice (for example, 3d6) like this: `(3d6*2)`. This works just **fine**, but you could get a little fancier and create a variable that holds the multiplier, for example, `VS`. You could then do `(3d6*VS)`. If you were to ever get Improved VS, you could change the single value `VS` from 2 to 3. If you only have a single weapon relying on Vital Strike, this is probably overkill.

For something like *Power Attack*, however, creating a variable is more useful since it relies upon a value that scales with your level.

 - Power Attack - hit: `1 + BAB/4`
 - Power Attack - damage : `2 + (BAB/4 * 2)`

Since receiving this question, I've added default expressions representing both: `PA_ATK` and `PA_DMG`.

Most people are probably going to use Power Attack two-handed. This is where [functions](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/eval#functions) come in handy.
 - Power Attack (two-handed) damage: `th(PA_DMG)`
 - Power Attack (off-handed) damage: `oh(PA_DMG)`

Finally, we can combine it with an:
 - attack roll: `PA_ATK + ATK_STR`. We can call this `PWR_HIT`
 - damage roll: `DMG_STR + th(PA_DMG)`. Let's call this one `PWR_DMG`

The attack and damage rolls would be modifiers for any attack you'd wish to use it with. For example, you would add +1 to the attack roll with a masterwork weapon. For damage, of course, add your weapons dice and any additional modifiers: `2d6 + PWR_DMG`. I would suggest putting weapon expressions into a `/row` instead of directly into your character sheet. You can do this by using `/var` and `Set-Row`.

### -> Does it support getting X to Y?
*from /u/Elgatee*

A common example would be changing your Intimidate skill to use Strength instead of Charisma via [Intimidating Prowess.](https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Intimidating%20Prowess)

The default expression for Intimidate (`ITM`) is: `1d20 + CHA + SK_ALL + SK_ITM`.

You can use [`/var`](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/var#var) with the `Set-Expression` action and `ITM` as the var-name. This will bring up a window with the original expression. Just change CHA to STR:

![setexpr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10622391/194178322-48c6c21a-508c-4107-ac1e-77a7d9f7f537.jpg)

![setexpr1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10622391/194178818-b3c40311-35d6-48f3-8064-bd58b6ab8666.jpg)
![setexpr2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10622391/194178823-343919f1-2cde-4bbb-af74-8a76b4cd6688.jpg)


### -> Does it support custom skills?
*from /u/Elgatee* (great questions all around)

Yep. While there are a number of ways to accomplish this, I will use the methods I use in the default statblock.

First, create a new `Stat` using [`/eval`](https://github.com/Gellybean/Mathfinder-Bot/wiki/eval) to assign a new variable.

![sk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10622391/194179766-0bdd32dd-7cb7-4261-aa3b-4e6f9fd402a0.jpg)

Then, create a new `Expression` using `/var` `Set-Expression` with a given var-name (I use just the three-letter abbreviation for all my expressions. It is often better to keep your expression names short because they are called directly more often). You can use the X to Y example above as a blueprint for how your skill may be calculated. 

*NOTE* — `SK_ALL` is a variable created for convenience purposes, mainly for modifiers that affect all skills. It is not required, but if removed it will cause problems with certain features, like preset-mods and certain character imports. I would recommend keeping it in all custom skill formulae unless you have a specific reason not to.
